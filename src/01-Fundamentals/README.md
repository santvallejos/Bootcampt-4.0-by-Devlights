# Fundamentals Exercises

## Overview
This module covers the fundamental concepts of C# programming including variables, data types, control flow, loops, and methods.

## Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you will understand:
- How to declare and use different data types (int, string, bool, decimal, etc.)
- Control flow statements (if/else, switch)
- Different types of loops (for, while, foreach)
- How to create and use methods with parameters and return values

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
Learn about different primitive types in C#:
- Integer types (int, long)
- Floating-point types (double, decimal)
- Character and string types
- Boolean type

### Exercise 2: Control Flow
Practice conditional logic:
- If-else statements
- Switch statements
- Making decisions in code

### Exercise 3: Loops
Master iteration patterns:
- For loops for counted iterations
- While loops for condition-based iterations
- Foreach loops for collection traversal

### Exercise 4: Methods
Understand functions and modular code:
- Creating methods with parameters
- Returning values from methods
- Method reusability

## Running the Exercise
```bash
dotnet run --project src/01-Fundamentals/Fundamentals/Fundamentals.csproj
```

## Next Steps
After mastering fundamentals, move on to the OOP exercises to learn about object-oriented programming in C#.
