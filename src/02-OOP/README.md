# Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

## Overview
This module demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you will understand:
- How to create classes and objects
- Encapsulation with properties and access modifiers
- Inheritance and code reuse
- Polymorphism and method overriding
- Abstract classes and their use cases
- Interfaces and contract-based programming

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Classes and Objects
Learn the basics of OOP:
- Creating classes with properties
- Constructors
- Instance methods
- Encapsulation with private fields

**Examples:**
- Person class with properties and methods
- BankAccount class demonstrating encapsulation

### Exercise 2: Inheritance
Understand code reuse through inheritance:
- Base classes and derived classes
- Constructor chaining with `base()`
- Virtual and override methods

**Examples:**
- Employee inherits from Person
- Manager inherits from Employee

### Exercise 3: Polymorphism
Master polymorphic behavior:
- Abstract classes
- Abstract methods
- Method overriding
- Runtime polymorphism

**Examples:**
- Animal abstract class
- Dog, Cat, and Bird implementations

### Exercise 4: Interfaces
Learn contract-based programming:
- Defining interfaces
- Implementing interfaces
- Multiple interface implementation

**Examples:**
- IShape interface
- Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle implementations

## Running the Exercise
```bash
dotnet run --project src/02-OOP/OOPExercises/OOPExercises.csproj
```

## Next Steps
After understanding OOP, move on to Collections to learn about data structures in C#.
